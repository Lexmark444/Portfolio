            <p className="text-md lg:text-lg py-2 leading-8 text-gray-800">
                My career trajectory is as diverse as it gets. From custom framing, real estate sales and development,
                 to surgical neurophysiology, and now web development. 
                With each career change, I have adapted and grown into a more <span className="text-sky-500">resilient individual</span>. 
                Every position I have held was <span className="text-sky-500">client facing </span> and involved some aspect of <span className="text-sky-500">sales</span>.
                Throughout my journey, I have been largely hands on with all of my work and I'm now excited 
                to bring my skills and talent to the world of software. Since I was in middle school,
                I have always been intruiged with technology, video games, and animation. Back in 2011, 
                my team and I placed 3rd in FBLA states for web application programming. I then went off to college to pursue
                a degree in <span className="text-sky-500"> Neuroscience</span> at <span className="text-sky-500">Rutgers-New Brunwick</span> . Throughout my time at Rutgers, 
                I kept gravitating towards cryptocurrency and eventually began building machines 
                to mine <span className="text-sky-500">ethereum </span> which involved minor <span className="text-sky-500"> linux programming</span>. 
                After graduating with my <span className="text-sky-500">Bachelor's degree</span>, I ran an ecommerce store 
                pre-covid and had plans to go back to school for programming. 
                However, when the pandemic began I realized that I had to
                 support my family and chose to become a surgical neurophysiologist. 
                 A small part of me was sad to give up on my dream, 
                 but grateful that I had another skill set to provide for my loved ones.
                 In 2023, I finally <span className="text-sky-500">graduated from Coding Temple's Self-Paced Bootcamp </span>while working full-time.
                 I'm so grateful that I'm able to learn and grow towards my dream again. 
                 One day, I hope to make impactful web applications
                 and experiences that bring positive change in people's lives.
